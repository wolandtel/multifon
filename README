	Motivation:
I've found only one working script for sending multifon SMS: https://github.com/vir/yate/wiki/Multifon-sms
The main problem is it's based on heavy project YATE. It was need simpler solution.

	Thanks:
To author of YATE multifon-sms script for information about specific headers.

1.Install patched version of sipsak
	git clone https://github.com/wolandtel/sipsak.git
	cd sipsak
	debuild -b -uc -us
	cd ..
	sudo dpkg -i sipsak_*-fox-*.deb

2. Copy sms.conf.sample to sms.conf and fill it with your phone number and multifon password

3. Send message
	./sms.sh 79aabbccddd "test message"
	./sms.sh 79aabbccddd "$(echo -en "Multiline\ntest message")"
	./sms.sh 79aabbccddd "$(echo -en "Тестовое сообщение\nв несколько строк")"

4. Debugging
	add line DEBUG=1 to sms.conf
	it's recomended to add '> sms.log 2> sms.err' to messsage command line while debug enabled

5. Troubleshooting
	If you receive 403 Forbidden:
	1. Check your credentials
	2. Enable debugging and look at Via: header of sending message. If it contains 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x,
		you have NAT and unroutable address on your interface. It's impossible to send SMS in such environment now.
	
	!!Message contents MUST be UTF-8 endoded.
